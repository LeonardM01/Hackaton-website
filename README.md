# A Ri-hack hackaton project
### Description 
A website with a theme set by the contest judges. It is a website made for making trash disposal easier in our city. 
### Techologies
A website made with React and Nodejs using MongoDB as a database. For state saving, we have used Redux and a backend (REST API) server has been made using Expressjs. For desinging the UI, we chose Figma and to make it easier to develop, we decided to implement MaterialUI (using its elements to make development faster). 
### Summary
The team achieved 9th place out of 11 teams and considering it was our first 24 hour hackaton (some of us even new to full stack development). We are proud of our product and will do even better next year.
